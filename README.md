![dag](docs/images/dag_small.svg)

soterd is a full soter node implementation written in Go (golang). It started as a fork of the [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd) project, where development focus has changed from providing a bitcoin node to providing an [implementation of blockdag](docs/intro_to_blockdag.md) for soter.

The intent of this project is for it to act as a component in Soteria's Trade Anything Platform (TAP); a pillar of Soteria's [Self Sustainable Decentralized Economy](https://www.ssde.io/) vision (SSDE).

This project is currently under active development and is in an [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) state. It can be considered unstable and has not been in production use as of April 2019.


## For beginners in blockdag/blockchain technology

The [Intro to Soter BlockDAG](docs/intro_to_blockdag.md) document describes what blockdag is, and how soter/blockdag is different from bitcoin/blockchain.


## For software developers

The [Developers Intro](docs/developers_intro.md) document describes the capabilities of soterd, installation and updates, and links to the developer resources. 


## Testnet Status

The current Testnet (testnet1) will get frequent update in terms of code and genesis block. (could be as frequent as multiple times a day) So if you are running a full node for testnet1, please keep this in mind :-).


## Documentation

Project documentation is located in the [docs](docs/README.md) folder.


## Issue Tracker

The [integrated github issue tracker](https://github.com/totaloutput/soterd/issues) is used for this project.
