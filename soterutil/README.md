Package soterutil provides bitcoin-related convenience functions and types.
A comprehensive suite of tests is provided to ensure proper functionality.  See
`test_coverage.txt` for the gocov coverage report.  Alternatively, if you are
running a POSIX OS, you can run the `cov_report.sh` script for a real-time
report.

This package was originally developed for btcd. Although it was primarily written for 
btcd, this package has intentionally been designed so it can be used as a standalone 
package for any projects needing the functionality provided.

## Overview of functionality

### Block Overview

A Block defines a bitcoin block that provides easier and more efficient
manipulation of raw wire protocol blocks.  It also memoizes hashes for the
block and its transactions on their first access so subsequent accesses don't
have to repeat the relatively expensive hashing operations.

### Tx Overview

A Tx defines a bitcoin transaction that provides more efficient manipulation of
raw wire protocol transactions.  It memoizes the hash for the transaction on its
first access so subsequent accesses don't have to repeat the relatively
expensive hashing operations.

### Address Overview

The Address interface provides an abstraction for a Bitcoin address.  While the
most common type is a pay-to-pubkey-hash, Bitcoin already supports others and
may well support more in the future.  This package currently provides
implementations for the pay-to-pubkey, pay-to-pubkey-hash, and
pay-to-script-hash address types.

To decode/encode an address:

	// NOTE: The default network is only used for address types which do not
	// already contain that information.  At this time, that is only
	// pay-to-pubkey addresses.
	addrString := "04678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962" +
		"e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d57" +
		"8a4c702b6bf11d5f"
	defaultNet := &chaincfg.MainNetParams
	addr, err := soterutil.DecodeAddress(addrString, defaultNet)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println(addr.EncodeAddress())
